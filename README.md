# Memory Game ðŸŽ®

**Memory Game** is a console-based C# application that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) and a clean separation between game logic and user interface (UI). This project emphasizes code organization and best practices in C# development.

## Overview

The project is structured to maintain a clear distinction between the core game logic and the console-based UI. Players can choose between two gameplay modes: playing against another player or challenging the computer. The game showcases strong OOP principles and is written in C# with a focus on maintainable, scalable code.

## Features

- **Separation of Concerns:** The game logic and UI are divided into separate modules, reflecting solid OOP design and maintainability.
- **Two Game Modes:** The game can be played in two modesâ€”against another player or against a computer opponent with basic AI.
- **Console-Based UI:** The interface is simple and text-based, running in the console to provide an accessible experience.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Core**
